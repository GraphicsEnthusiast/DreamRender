# DreamRender

My cpu offline renderer for learning. If I have time, I will keep refactoring the code. I don't plan on writing scene analysis, it's too tiring. Some features I want to implement in the future: (1) heterogeneous medium; (2) approximate bssrdf; (3) hair material; (4) dreamworks fabric material; (5) volumetric bidirectional path tracing; (6) stochastic progressive photon mapping...
